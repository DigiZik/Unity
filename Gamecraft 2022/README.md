# Op-Teh-Bing Gamecraft 2022
Created with friends to make a neverending running game 

## Theme: Magic and Science

## Game: Project Ninja

We created a game based on magic, where the player is able to bounce indefinitely and science,
in which the player is able to make use of different elements to open up rooms or destry obstacles.
Overall, it was an exciting adventure as we only have a few days to make a game, but it helped us in gaining
more in depth knowledge

The game can be found on itch.io: https://knifecatcher.itch.io/project-ninja
